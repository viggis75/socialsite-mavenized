Socialsite-mavenized is maven-based fork of Project Socialsite.

"Project Socialsite is delivering social networking functionality by adding social networking platform support based on the OpenSocial standard to any community site. Any social application written using the OpenSocial API can be seamlessly and easily hosted on a transformed community site that is powered by Project Socialsite"

Problem in original Project socialsite:
Currently, Project SocialSite uses a complex Ant build to compile deliverables.

Solution in socialsite-mavenized:
To help manage dependencies and make deployment easier as well as possibly make socialsite work on platforms other than glassfish, we believe that socialsite needs to be maven-ized. This project is our attempt at mavenizing socialsite.
